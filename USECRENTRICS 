3. Ensuring availability (Art. 32 para. 1 lit b GDPR)
Measures to ensure that personal data are protected against accidental destruction or loss.
Specific measures for our production environment (Consent Management Platform) & related systems
Usercentrics does not operate its own server resources in its own data centers. For the production
system (CMP) and related systems, Microsoft Azure resources (Microsoft Ireland Operations Ltd, One
Microsoft Place, South County Business Park, Leopardstown, Dublin 18 D18) are used.
The following measures are employed to ensure the availability of systems and data:
● All systems and data exist in Microsoft Azure datacenters and are dependent on their
availability as described here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/infrastructure-availability.
● Data is stored in geo-redundant systems.
● Our productive environment is backed up at regular intervals or data mirroring procedures are
used.
● The systems are protected by an uninterruptible power supply (UPS).
● A multi-layer virus protection and firewall architecture is used.
● Data files collected for different purposes are stored separately.
● Regular patch management.
● Load balancing.
● Data storage is added as part of dynamic processes.
● Penetration and load tests are carried out regularly.
● The load limit for each data processing system is set above the necessary minimum in
advance of data processing.
● For specific Usercentrics systems, the following measures are implemented:
o Systems health and activities are monitored both by automatic sub-systems and
human employees.
o Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are employed at the network access endpoints to
the critical systems.
